AWP - AWS Which Profile

BASIC FUNC

First arg
Type of profile
e.g. firm, app, res, legacy,

Second arg
Identifier of profile
Begin with verbatims e.g. F100630/voya, shared-services, legacy, application-live
Then add some manual short names myself
Later use something fuzzy to resolve any short name

LATER
Option to pull the latest AWS configs from the machine-build repo?
(if it's being run by an ea cli user, they will probably have git access)
Could do something that prints the aws login url for a profile to stdout
